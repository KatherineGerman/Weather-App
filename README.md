A simple web application that shows the current weather of any city, the local time, and a dynamic background related to the city and weather conditions.

## What I Learned

- How to fetch data from APIs using JavaScript (`fetch` and Promises).
- How to work with JSON responses and destructuring objects.
- How to manipulate the DOM dynamically to display data.
- How to calculate local time based on timezone offsets.


## What the App Does

- Search weather by city.
- Displays:
  - City name
  - Weather icon
  - Weather description
  - Temperature (¬∞C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Wind speed (km/h)
  - Local time (AM/PM)
- Sets a dynamic background image based on the city and weather.
- Automatically uses a fallback image if Unsplash API fails.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- APIs:
  - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) ‚Äì for weather data
  - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) ‚Äì for dynamic background images
  - [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) ‚Äì fallback background images



```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
